Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP:

   * HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. It is used in client-server communication. 
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 
There are several stages of development of HTTP such as HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 and the latest
HTTP/2.0.

HTTP 1.1:

   * It's an upgraded version of basic version HTTP 1.0 which made things faster by allowing 
the computer to reuse the information it recieved from the server. 
   * For better understanding, let’s assume the situation when you make a request to the server for 
the example.html page and server responds to you as a resource example.html page. before sending the 
request and the response, there is a TCP connection established between client and server. 
   * Again you make a request to the server for image img.jpg and the server gives a response as an image 
img.jpg. the connection was not lost here after the first request because we add a keep-alive header 
which is the part of the request so there is an open connection between the server & client. There is a 
persistent connection which means several requests and responses are merged in a single connection.
   * HTTP 1.1 transfer all the requests and responses in the plain text message form. The head of 
line blocking in which TCP connection is blocks all other requests until the every responses is not 
received. All the information related to the header file is repeated in every request. This was seen 
as a major drawback of this version.

HTTP 2.0:

   * The drawbacks in the previous version leads to the creation of HTTP 2.0, where the computer
can send and recieve more information at the same time.
   * HTTP 2.0 was developed over the SPDY protocol. It works on the binary framing layer instead of 
textual that converts all the messages in binary format. It works on fully multiplexed, that is one TCP 
connection is used for multiple requests. HTTP 2.0 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. 
   * It compresses the header. The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request 
of the client using the PUSH frame.

The major differences of HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 2.0 is:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               HTTP 1.1                            |                  HTTP 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * It works on the textual format                |   * It works on the binary protocol
   * There is head of line blocking that blocks    |   * It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection 
   all the requests behind it until it doesn’t     |   is required for multiple requests 
   get its all resources                           |
   * It uses requests resource Inlining for use    |   * It uses PUSH frame by server that collects 
   getting multiple pages                          |   all multiple pages
   * It compresses data by itself                  |   *It uses HPACK for data compression
